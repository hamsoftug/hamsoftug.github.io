According to Wikipedia a software is defined as "Computer software, or simply software is any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer's processor to perform specific operations."   

For detailed explanation of software please read this [Wikipedia article.](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Software)

But today we will take you to a tour on how we build software solutions for the problems that our clients and partners face on a daily basis.

Now lets get to code ..... Psssssss! am kidding who even does that ???

I know some people when they think about software their brain quickly thinks about code , forget about that Software which  is usually designed and created (a.k.a. coded/written/programmed) in integrated development environments (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ and Microsoft Visual Studio ( there will be a long long list if to name all the IDEs) that can simplify the process and compile (process of converting computer language instructions to machine code)   (if applicable at all).

I will share the non functional process that happen behind the scene before anyone opens their text editor or IDE whatever you may want to call it.
